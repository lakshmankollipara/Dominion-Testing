I have converted dominion.c to dominion.py
with initialize game not taking gamestate as input anymore and returning a gamestate.
i implemented 13 kingdomcards in cardEffect with 5 known Bugs which wont carsh.

and I wrote unit tests for below functions:
initialize game
shuffle
buycard&gainCard
discardCard
playCard
drawCrad
updateCoins
which will take random input and stops if assert fails
you can find unit tests in files with 'unittest_' prefix
