 The only real problem with uncovered areas was the part in the beginning where the deck will be shuffled if it is empty:
	obviously, this will only proc 1 in MAX_DECK amounts of times. I added a 1 in 3 chance for the deck to be set to empty
	so that this will happen more often

I didn't have any real problems with coverage on the smithy card.
